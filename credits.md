Begin testing terminal/computer scripts in unity
Formatted scripting and line spacing in terminal.
Improved terminal functionality and acquired resources
Explored resources and gathered assets.
Learned about new terminology and functions in C# and put them to use, such as Enumerators in Computer.cs
Learned about Visual Studio behaviours and functions to extract methods and quickly refactor code.
// Have successfully used Enumeration and States to manage my states and scenes to give the bare minimum function needed to check a single password. MVP for the Computer has been completed. Beginning Stretch Goals.
Have successfully utilized update and debug mode in Unity to search for errors and access debug/backend information, learned about how to better use switch cases in C# as well as randomly pulling objects from an array.
Successfully learned how to implement ASCII art into C# code - including the syntax needed with functional examples.
Baseline game functionality for initial scene is completed -- Computer Terminal // Will apply slight polish and clean up some sections of code.
Code polished, successfully built and exported to zip, runnable on unity and setup base portfolio at itch.io address ( https://zentraxius.itch.io/computeranagram )
// End Scene 1 //
Begin Scene 2
Drafting out 'Rocket Pilot Application'
Experimental version control testing, attempted to make custom assets
Base level created, launch pad, terrain, colored terrain, directional light with 3d shadowing functioning, custom set camera angles
Beginning to make custom models for rocket ship.
Made "placeholder" foreverRocket and attached custom collision mesh, attached initial script, beginning to track user input
User input has been tracked, debugged, and applied with Space being universally available, A takes priority over D for left/right turning.
User input has been improved, thrust and launch enabled, directional based performance implemented, isolated rigidbody function responsible for spinning rocket of death, removed function responsible for spinning rocket of death
Begin to add audiosourcing, adjusted details of collision for landing sequence // todo : Custom landing *feet* // Update all existing models to prefabs and adjusted prefab sources to take precedence in heirarchy - enabled update for rocket.
Add free sound effect from freesound.org, obtaining one with creative commons zero license.
Initial audio settings implemented, adjusted collision mesh and rendering, added debug line to code
Audio sounds improved, audio now begins on space enter, and ends on space release, fixed looping error.
Added linear drag to make movement more realistic, added landing platform/obstacles, fixed new spinning death rocket bug, enhanced mobility and expanded terrain size, added colors
New bug introduced - rapid pressing of space to stabilize momentum results in former clicking sound bug to be reintroduced, refactored code.
Bug won this round, added variable to change speed of rocket for both thrust and rotation.
Adjusted plane and camera
Added detection for collision and output for determining which tagged collisions have been made
Completed current work on tags, moving on to improving level design.
Add initial obstacle and create collision collider .
