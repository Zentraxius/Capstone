# Unity Development Project

#### A collection of Unity Projects

## Description

This repo is a collection of my major unity projects that are done entirely solo, they are focused on Unity 3D, this repository specifically will contain 2 projects, or scenes, in total, a Computer_Anagram game, and a 3D rocket flight game built, both projects build to test out and learn various functions in the Unity Development Studio, after those two projects are finished, this github will contain links to future projects as they are worked on.
